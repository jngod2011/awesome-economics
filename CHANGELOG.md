### 2017-08-03  (tag: v1.17.0803)  MAJOR

This *v1 will be the last exact sync with upstream* repository
https://github.com/antontarasenko/awesome-economics
in the *main* line of development.

Henceforth, it shall be a **hard fork** such that the
antontarasenko repository is mirrored in the ***default*** branch,
while we move on in the ***master*** branch
with more emphasis on financial economics.

*Those two branches shall not merge*, though the plan is to be
cooperative in that the two separate repositories may
cherry-pick from each other in the future.
